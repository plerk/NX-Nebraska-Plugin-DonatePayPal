nice to have:
 - proper \foot{} and \cut{} support for Ziyal documents.
 - the perl dist is really geared for making a debian package.  write some
   code to make modifications to the dist to make it debian package building
   ready, and have it do the normal (if wierd) Catalyst installing stuff
   on a regular cpan install.
